\section{Conclusion}
From the results, we are able to give an answer to our research question: Does the number of tweets about a game relate to the number of copies sold in Europe?

Certain games have a large variance in tweet counts around their release, after which the hype seems to die down quickly. This can for example be seen with the FIFA franchise. These games tend to release and then be played a lot by various players, then fall off before the release of the next year's FIFA game. 

Other games tend to have a more constant player base. This can be seen with the game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, where the majority of tweets are sent outside of the game's release date. Around 500 to 1000 tweets are sent about this game every day.

By looking at the graphs there is clearly a correlation between the number of tweets about a game and the sales numbers for some games, but definitely not for all of them. For example for Minecraft there is no clear relation, which is likely because of the small incremental updates the game has instead of full blown releases. The 1.0 update of Minecraft was more of a name change (removal of the \emph{beta} tag) instead of a real release. However for games that do have a clear release date, the correlation shows quite clearly. For example the FIFA games show that there is a clear correlation, the curve of the tweet count matches that of the sales numbers quite well. Due to the lack of precise sales numbers (only a number for each week) we cannot statistically confirm this.

The sentiment of tweets might also have an impact on sales records. The tweets might also be about various flaws or bugs in a game, which will likely result in less copies being sold. Therefore, in order to give a better estimation of the number of copies sold depending on the amount of tweets, it might be useful to perform sentiment analysis on these tweets. Next to this more precise sales numbers of games would improve the results, it is likely that the used source has this data but does not publish data on the web.
