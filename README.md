### GameTweets

This repository contains the methods used in Twitter data research. The research investigates if the number of tweets about a certain video game is linked to the number of sold copies in Europe. The used data is provided by [Twiqs.nl](www.twiqs.nl), and contains most of the tweets from The Netherlands from late 2010 until late 2015. The tweets are mostly in Dutch, because that is the target language Twiqs is collecting.
